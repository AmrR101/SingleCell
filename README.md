# SingleCell
In this repository you will find scripts that help you filter and analyze and visualize single cell data using the R packages 'Seurat' and 'SCDE'.

The scripts are written for use with single cell UMI-based transcriptomic data, and were tested in datasets ranging from ~1000-5000 T-cells.
